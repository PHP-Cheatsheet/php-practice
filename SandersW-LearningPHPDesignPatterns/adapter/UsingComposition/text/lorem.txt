This will tell the component that you want to re-use a CSRF token until it expires - which is controlled by the csrfExpires value. If you are having issues with expired tokens, this is a good balance between security and ease of use.

Disabling the CSRF protection
There may be cases where you want to disable CSRF protection on your forms for some reason. If you do want to disable this feature, you can set $this->Security->csrfCheck = false; in your beforeFilter or use the components array. By default CSRF protection is enabled, and configured to use one-use tokens.

Disabling Security Component For Specific Actions
There may be cases where you want to disable all security checks for an action (ex. AJAX requests). You may “unlock” these actions by listing them in $this->Security->unlockedActions in your beforeFilter.
